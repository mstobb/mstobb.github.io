My Thoughts on Teaching
Teaching is one of my life&rsquo;s true passions.  I believe that helping others learn (and learning how to learn!) is one of the unique joys in life.  This page lists my thoughts on teaching.
My teaching philosophy is based on the principle of an active partnership between instructors and students.  I see the educator as being responsible for explaining/demonstrating new skills for multiple learning modalities, giving students opportunities to develop those skills for themselves, and allowing students to appropriately gauge their level of understanding to know when to seek out further assistance.  Similarly, I see the student as needing to be receptive to new information, willing to work diligently to acquire new skills, and empowered to ask for help when needed.  None of us are these things all the time, but my personal goal in teaching is to always inspire students to greater success by owning their own personal responsibility in the learning process.
