&lt;p&gt;This page contains notes, further readings, and general references for the associated lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big paper to read is by Kaplan et al. titled &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361"&gt;Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models&lt;/a&gt;. The authors were all OpenAI researchers and would go on (with significant investor support) to produce some of the best AI models ever created (one of the authors was Dario Amodei who later left OpenAI and cofounded Anthropic, another AI lab that currently produces the Claude AI models). This paper was very much a blend of hard Machine Learning research (note that it does at times get quite technical) and a pitch for financial investors that their money wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
