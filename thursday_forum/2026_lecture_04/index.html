AI Energy and Water Use
Lot&rsquo;s of different numbers were quoted in lecture. Here are some of the sources I pulled those numbers from:

Google Gemini energy usage from Google, so good for transparency but you have to trust the source
MIT Tech Review article on AI Energy Use
General energy consumption information from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) on AC and lots of other stuff
An excellent report on the energy consumption for Data Centers with the breakdown of energy compute vs. HVAC and the different cooling techniques used.
Goldman Sachs article on the estimated spending on AI for 2026
Wikipedia page on Jevons Paradox is quite good for getting a basic understanding of it
Water consumption estimates for various things from the USGS and hamburger consumption estimates for the US
Good article summarizing the state of AI and water consumption
