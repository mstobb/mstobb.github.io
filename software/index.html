A few examples of my code (those that I&rsquo;m able to make publicly available) can be seen on my GitHub page.  Some are just for fun (like the battleship simulator), while others were made for research purposes.

Event Placer: A free tool to schedule events into a limited number of rooms. Built with Coe Students.
Event Placer V2: A rewrite of the above tool that uses strictly client-side compute - its faster than the original!
Habit Visualizer: A webapp to display daily calendar habits. You have to do the tracking though.
Ladybug Problem: 3Blue1Brown posted a fun Ladybug problem that was just begging for another brute force solution.

Recommended Software Things I use and recommend:\nJulia: A newish programming language first made available in 2012, Julia focuses on performance and efficiency without sacrificing clarity. Julia has a syntax that closely resembles Mathwork’s MATLAB, but is open source and freely available. More importantly, due to the central placement of multiple dispatch and a strong type system, Julia is able to achieve speeds close to native C (for some applications). While imperfect, Julia has almost solved the two-language problem in my work and has become my favorite language for coding.\nDatasette: A super neat tool for sharing data interactively. Data is stored in the open SQLite database format and then Datasette provides an interactive web-application to explore and visualize it. All the server parts are taken care of! Makes sharing data with others really straightforward, so long as you have access to a public facing web server.\nDuckDB: An open source, in process, OLAP database. Essentially SQLite but columnar and fast. Its interop abilities with Python Pandas dataframes are also amazing!\n","wordCount":"281","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":{"email":"michael@stobb.org","name":"Michael Stobb"}},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://stobb.org/software/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Michael T.
